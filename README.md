This Android application provides the user with the posibility to play a radio station stream at a specific date and time.<br />
Similar to an alarm radio clock, you can set the time and what Radio Station will be played at the specific time. <br />
You can set the Radio Station through a Radio Browser provided in the application. <br />
I use the community Radio API to query for the radio stations: -->  [Community Radiostation Index Webservice](http://www.radio-browser.info/webservice).<br />

If you need to wake up in the mornings with a radio station, you just select the time and the app will play the radio station!!!! Enjoy!!! <br />
