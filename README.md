This Android application provides the user with the posibility to play a radio station stream at a specific date and time. 
Similar to an alarm radio clock, you can set the time and for now (V 1.0) play a Colombian radio station: [Radioactiva 97.9 FM](http://www.radioacktiva.com/).

If you need to wake up in the mornings with a radio station, you just select the time and the app will open the radio station (in future versions, there is going to be a radio station browser).


### Release: V1.0

I have just released the first version of the application!!!!.
In this version you can set times and play with basic functionalitites.
For more details see:

-->  [RadioWakeUpARC V 1.0](https://github.com/aliriorivera/RadioWakeUpARC/releases/tag/v1.0).
